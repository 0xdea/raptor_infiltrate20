1. Abstract.

A buffer overflow in the _SanityCheck() function in the Common Desktop
Environment version distributed with Oracle Solaris 10 1/13 (Update 11) and
earlier allows local users to gain root privileges via a long calendar name or
calendar owner passed to sdtcm_convert in a malicious calendar file.

The open source version of CDE (based on the CDE 2.x codebase) is not affected,
because it does not ship the vulnerable program.

2. Example Attack Session.

3. Affected Platforms.

All platforms shipping the Common Desktop Environment based on the CDE 1.x
codebase are potentially affected. This includes:

* Oracle Solaris 10 1/13 (Update 11) and earlier [default installation]

The open source version of CDE (based on the CDE 2.x codebase) is not affected,
because it does not ship the vulnerable program.

4. Fix.

Oracle has assigned the tracking# S1239395 and has released a fix for all
affected and supported versions of Solaris in the Critical Patch Update (CPU)
of April 2020.

As a workaround, it is also possible to remove the setuid bit from the
vulnerable executable as follows (note that this might prevent it from working
properly):

bash-3.2# chmod -s /usr/dt/bin/sdtcm_convert

Please note that during the audit many other potentially exploitable bugs have
surfaced in sdtcm_convert and in the Common Desktop Environment in general.
Therefore, removing the setuid bit from all CDE binaries is recommended,
regardless of patches released by vendors.

5. Proof of Concept.

An exploit for Oracle Solaris 10 1/13 (Update 11) Intel has been developed as a
proof of concept. It can be downloaded from:
